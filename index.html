  These are my <b>notes</b> on my first 
day of signing up for <em>Intro to Programming</em>.<br>
<br>
HTML - Hypertext Markup Language<br><br>
HTML is made up of:<br>
-text content "what you see"<br>
-markup "what it looks like"<br>
-references to other documents (e.g images or videos)<br><br>
www.udacity.com/html_playground is where I can play around with coding.<br>,<br>
HTML MARKUP<BR>
Opening Tag, Closing Tag, Element includes both plus contents between the two tags<br><br>
HTML documents are denpendent on HTML elements.<br><br>
HTML MARKUP includes <b>bold</b>, <em>emphsis or italics</em><br><br>
HTML ATTRIBUTE includes anchor tags for links, image tags for graphics<br><br>
White Space is how text appears on multiple lines. The break tag is considered inline and a void tag. The paragraph tag is considered block and not a void tag.<br><br>
The break tag ends a line, whereas the paragraph tag makes an invisible box around text.<br><br>
SPAN tag is inline.<br>
DIV tag is block.
